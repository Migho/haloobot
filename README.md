# haloobot

A Telegram bot that automates meme spouting.

Quickstart:
1. Get yourself Python 3.5+
2. Install telepot, dataset and emoji with pip
3. Create a bot and get yourself a bot API key with @BotFather
...* Make sure to disable group privacy for your bot while you're at it (haloobot won't work otherwise!)
4. Create a file called 'haloosettings' with contents somewhat like this:
...```
...key = <your Telegram bot API key>
...password = <password for bot owner specific commands>
...```
5. Run haloobot.py
6. Add the bot to some conversation
7. Give haloobot a /breaksilence to break initial silence and then go for /listcommands

I might document this a bit more someday.

I'm sorry.
